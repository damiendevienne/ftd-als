# Age-dependent Carrier Probability of the C9orf72 Repeat Expansion

This repository contains the R code and data accompanying the paper **"Age-dependent carrier probability of the C9orf72 repeat expansion"**. The study proposes a way to compute the probability, for a healthy individual whose parent (or grandparent) carries the C9orf72 repeat expansion, to carry it himself given its age, using data from Murphy et al. (2017). You can access Murphy et al.'s paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00000-0).

## Contents

- **`Age-dep-proba.R`**: R script for data processing, probability computations, and visualization of age-dependent carrier probabilities.
- **`C9_Data.csv`**: Copy of the dataset from Murphy et al. (2017).
